# Inside Chat fork of Element Web

This is the Element Web build used by **Inside Chat**, the internal messenger of Inside Estate
(Matrix server `lobby.inside.estate`). Deployment, configuration and the visual skin live in a
separate repository, `balakirev/inside-chat`; this repository holds only changes to the app itself.

## Branches and tags

| Ref                      | Meaning                                                        |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `inside/main`            | upstream release tag (see `.inside-base`) + our commits on top |
| `inside-v<upstream>-<n>` | image that production pins to, e.g. `inside-v1.12.32-1`        |

Every Inside change is a separate, small commit on `inside/main`, so it can be re-applied on top of
the next upstream release with `git rebase --onto <new-tag> <old-tag> inside/main`.

## What we change and why

| Change                             | Why                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Caption field in the upload dialog | Users expect to send a photo with a caption in one message, as in other messengers. Uses Matrix media captions (`body` = caption, `filename` = file name), which Element and Element X already render. |

## Build

`.github/workflows/inside-docker.yaml` runs the tests related to our changes and builds
`ghcr.io/balakirev/inside-element-web` from the stock `apps/web/Dockerfile`.

## Licence

Element Web is licensed under AGPL-3.0 (see `LICENSE-AGPL-3.0`). This repository is public so that
users of Inside Chat can get the source of the version they use, as the AGPL requires.
